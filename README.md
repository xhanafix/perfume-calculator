‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Customizing the Perfume Ratio
The core logic of the calculator is based on a 60/40 ratio (60% alcohol base, 40% perfume oil). If you use a different ratio (e.g., 70/30), you can easily change it.
 * Open the index.html file.
 * Scroll down to the <script> tag at the bottom.
 * Find these two lines in the // --- ===== COST CALCULATION ===== --- section:
   const baseAmountInFinal = finalQuantity * 0.60; // <-- Change this value
const oilAmountInFinal = finalQuantity * 0.40;  // <-- Change this value

 * Adjust the decimal values to match your desired ratio. Ensure they add up to 1.0 (e.g., 0.70 and 0.30 for a 70/30 split).
 * Save the file, and the calculator will now use your custom ratio.
